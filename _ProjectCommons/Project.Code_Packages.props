      Provides Microsoft's/.NET's static code analyzers.

      NOTE: While - since .NET 5 - the code analyzers ship with the .NET SDK, the shipped
        version will only update when the SDK itself updates (which - on Windows - usually means
        an update of Visual Studio). With this NuGet package reference we have full control
        over the version that's being used (and can upgrade faster than the SDK, if necessary).
        See: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/4506

      NOTE 2: We could instead use <AnalysisLevel>5.0.3</AnalysisLevel> - but with a NuGet package
        we can "ask" NuGet whether a newer version is available. This is not possible with <AnalysisLevel>.
        So we keep using the NuGet package.
